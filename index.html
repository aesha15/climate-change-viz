                activities. It argues that humans have made significant damaging contributions to climate change and
                temperatures are in fact rising sharply, implying the urgency of the matter and immediate
                call-to-action. <br><br>

                Some notable events that indicate strong human contribution are: <br>
                1. The non-decreasing graph post World War II in 1939-1945, likely due to substantial increase in urbanization, modernization and industrialization. <br>
                2. We also see a high spike in the temperatures in 2011, that is when the Fukushima disaster occurred - yet another human-induced tragedy.

                        <b>Introduction: </b>
            Climate change and global warming are controversial topics, with debates centering around the extent of
            human
            influence, the urgency of action, and the potential consequences. Proponents of immediate action argue that
            human
            activities are driving climate change with severe consequences, while skeptics may question the extent of
            human
            impact or the reliability of climate models.
            <br><br>
            <b> Dataset Source: </b> <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/">NASA's Climate Change Data</a>. <br>
            <b>Navigating to the Dataset:</b> <br>
            - On the home page of the link above: Earth Observations -> Temperature -> GISS Surface Temperature Analysis
            (GISTEMP). <br>
            - Once on the GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v4) page, scroll down to "Tables of Global and
            Hemispheric Monthly Means and Zonal Annual Means". <br>
            - The dataset used is the CSV file for "Global-mean monthly, seasonal, and annual means, 1880-present,
            updated through most recent month". <br>

            <b>Data pre-processing:</b> Both the charts use the same data. However, I have made a few simple
            modifications to the dataset - <br>
            1. Filtered the data to only contain the values starting from the Year 1980. <br>
            2. Aggregated the values of the 12 months of the year (Jan-Dec) each given in the dataset to get a "mean"
            for each year. This "mean" of each year is represented in the line charts.<br><br>

            <b>Rhetoric/Framing Techniques used:</b><br>
            <b>1. Y-Axis Scale Range:</b> The scale for the y-axis for both the charts is different. The scale for the chart on the
            left is fitted precisely to the minimum and maximum values in the dataset thus offering a detailed, microscopic view of
            the plot. On the contrary, the scale for the right chart extends far beyond the dataset's extreme values. This creates
            the illusion of minimal variation in the graph, suggesting a relatively stable trend. <br>
            <b>2. Color Scheme:</b> The color palette for both charts is thoughtfully selected, intentionally creating a
            subconscious mental bias. The left chart is drawn with a vibrant, warm red color, instilling a sense of
            urgency and suggesting potential negative impacts. Conversely, the right chart is presented in a natural, earthy, and
            tranquil blue tone, encouraging a more relaxed interpretation.
