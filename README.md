Two visually compelling charts created from the same dataset to depict divergent views on Global Warming and highlight the influence of subtle visualization techniques on shaping viewer perception.

This was done as a part of an assignment for the course CSE 578 - Data Visualization at ASU.

## Problem Statement Summary 

The goal of this assignment is to create a pair of data visualizations that argue for opposing viewpoints, using the same base dataset.

**Design requirements:**  

- Create two visualizations using techniques from the Storytelling lecture and the visualization rhetoric paper, framing a dataset with opposing narratives. 

- First, find a dataset about a "controversial" topic. In other words, you want a topic with strong opinions on both sides of the issue. Here are some examples of topics that could work: political issue, science, religion, sociocultural, economics, immigration, sports, climate change, geopolitical sovereignty, etc.

- Create an *index.html* page with two visualizations side-by-side, each arguing for and against the controversial viewpoint. Both visualizations should use the same base dataset but may differ in preprocessing methods.  Employ rhetorical techniques like filtering, attribute selection, and color choice to frame each visualization. The Hullman paper on framing effects describes an extensive collection of framing and styling techniques you can use to help frame your visualizations for promoting a specific viewpoint, story, or argument. 

- Provide titles and captions for each chart, along with an introduction to the topic and links to the dataset source. Describe the rhetorical techniques used in each chart and explain their persuasive nature.


## My work

I chose to present contrasting perspectives on Global Warming to examine the rate at which climate change has unfolded over the last century and derive insights into whether it is caused by human activities or simply natural climate fluctuations.

I use a couple of Rhetoric/Framing techniques to make the visualization appealing and effectively convey the impact of how a few simple modifications on the visualization can manipulate the viewerâ€™s perception.
